Functionalities: 
		1. Home page
		2. Description Page( We have described the theoritical part of the Topic)
		3. Algorithm Page(we have described 3 different algorithms)
		4. Implementation page(In this page we have shown how the algorithms works and
						if some processes comes to memory how memory is allocating according to
						the algorithm)
		5. Login Page(For user to access quiz)
